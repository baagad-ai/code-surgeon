First off, thank you for considering contributing to code-surgeon! It's people like you that make code-surgeon such a great skill.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check the issue list as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title**
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem**
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps**
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why**
* **Include depth mode used** (QUICK, STANDARD, or DEEP)
* **Include codebase characteristics** if relevant (monorepo, framework, language)

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. When creating an enhancement suggestion, please include:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title**
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement**
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**
* **Describe the current behavior and the expected behavior**
* **Explain why this enhancement would be useful**

### Pull Requests

* Fill in the required template
* Follow the code style guidelines
* Include appropriate test cases
* Update documentation as needed
* End all files with a newline

## Code Style

### For Skill Files
- Keep SKILL.md content focused and expert-knowledge driven
- Avoid redundant explanations
- Maintain the 5-phase pipeline structure
- Include specific examples and error handling
- Document breaking changes and edge cases

### For Documentation
- Use clear, descriptive language
- Include code examples where appropriate
- Keep markdown formatting consistent
- Use tables for comparisons
- Add links to relevant sections

## Development Setup

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/code-surgeon.git`
3. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-feature`
4. Make your changes
5. Test your changes thoroughly
6. Commit with clear messages: `git commit -m "Add: description of change"`
7. Push to your branch: `git push origin feature/my-feature`
8. Open a Pull Request

## Commit Message Guidelines

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
* Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
  * ✨ `:sparkles:` when adding a new feature
  * 🐛 `:bug:` when fixing a bug
  * 📚 `:books:` when writing documentation
  * ♻️ `:recycle:` when refactoring code
  * ⚡ `:zap:` when improving performance
  * 🧪 `:test_tube:` when adding tests

## Testing

Before submitting a pull request, test your changes:

1. **Verify SKILL.md integrity** — Ensure the skill file is still valid YAML/Markdown
2. **Test with different depth modes** — QUICK, STANDARD, and DEEP
3. **Test with various frameworks** — React, Django, Express, Rails, etc.
4. **Check error handling** — Verify all error scenarios work as expected
5. **Validate documentation** — Ensure all links work and examples are correct

## Style Guide

### Documentation
- Use markdown formatting consistently
- Include code blocks with language specifiers
- Use tables for structured information
- Keep lines under 100 characters
- Use clear headings and hierarchy

### Code Examples
- Provide complete, runnable examples
- Include input and output
- Comment complex logic
- Show multiple approaches when relevant

## Additional Notes

### Issue and Pull Request Labels

* `bug` — Something isn't working
* `enhancement` — New feature or request
* `documentation` — Improvements or additions to documentation
* `good first issue` — Good for newcomers
* `question` — Further information is requested
