### Rollback Procedure

If critical issues emerge during Phase 1 or Phase 2:

1. **Immediate Actions (< 5 min):**
   - Disable new feature for affected user population
   - Activate previous stable version
   - Begin incident investigation

2. **Communication (5-15 min):**
   - Notify affected users
   - Update status page
   - Escalate to engineering leadership

3. **Root Cause Analysis (15-60 min):**
   - Identify issue in isolated environment
   - Prepare fix if applicable
   - Plan re-deployment strategy

4. **Re-Deployment:**
   - Once fix verified, return to Phase 1 soft launch
   - Repeat validation before broader expansion
